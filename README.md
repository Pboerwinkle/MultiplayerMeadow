Model for client and server

it's probably not very good, i'm just using it as a place
to keep it so I can test it over long distances.

run the server with [python3 MMServer.py PORT](default is 15000)

run the client with [client.py MMClient.py IPADDRESS PORT](defaults are 127.0.0.1 and 15000 respectively)
